For a tutorial session I created this Jupyter Notebook in which I try to explain the concepts of a Logistic Regression and the related Linear Regression. These are than first coded in Tensorflow and later recreated using Numpy. Feel free to use the material, ask questions, send comments, or just a thank you message.

## Prerequisits for this tutorial:
- a working anaconda / miniconda environment.
- a shell (powershell / bash / or equivalent)

## Create the a new Python environment and download the required packages:
1) open a shell
2) conda create --name tutor python=3.7
3) conda activate tutor
4) pip install tensorflow pandas jupyterlab matplotlib
(for completeness, I also provided a requirements.txt, but the above should work.)

## Open Jupyter Lab in the working directory which has the Notebook and Data:
1) jupyter lab
2) In jupyter lab, open the notebook named: Logistic_Regression.ipynb
