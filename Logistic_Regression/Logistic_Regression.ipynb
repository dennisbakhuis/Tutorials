    "## 1) A short note on why Logistic Regression is a building block for Deep Learning\n",
    "When we hear or read about *deep learning* we generally mean the subfield of machine learning using *artificial neural networks* (ANN). These computing systems are quite succesful in solving complex problems in various fields, examples are, image recognition, language modelling, and speech recognition. While the name ANN implies that they are related to the inner workings of our brain, the truth is that they mainly share some terminology. An ANN generally consists of multiple interconnected layers, which on itself is build using neurons (also called nodes). An typical example is shown below:\n",

    "In this example, we have one input layer, consisting of four individual inputs nodes. This input layer is 'fully connected' to the first hidden layer, i.e. Fully connected means that each input is connected to each node. The first hidden layer is again fully connected to another 'hidden' layer. The term hidden indicates that we are not directly interact with these layers and these are kind of obscured to the user. The second hidden layer is on its turn fully connected two the final output layer, which consists of two nodes. So in this example we feed the model four inputs and we will receive two outputs.\n"

    "Let's now focus on a single neuron from our previous example. This neuron still is connected to all inputs, which are also called features. Using these features, the neuron calculates a single response (or output). A diagram of such a system looks like this:\n",

    "The input features are named $f^1$, $f^2$, $f^3$, and $f^4$ and are all connected to our single neuron. This neuron executes two operations. First, a multiplication of each feature with a weight($W$) and adding a bias ($b$). The second and final operation is a so called *activation function*, indicated by $\\sigma$. This results in a probability between zero and one as the output. A single neuron acts like a small logistic regression model and therefore, an ANN can be seen as a bunch of interconnected logistic regression models stacked together. While this idea is pretty neat, the underlying truth is a bit more subtle. There are many different architectures for ANNs and they can use various building blocks that act qute different than in this example."

    "The differences between linear regressions and a logistic regressions are not major. There are two differences from the previous code we created. First, our linear regression model only had a single feature, which we inputted with $x$, meaning that we only had a single weight. In logistic regression, you generally input more than one feature, and each will have its own weight. This will change the previous simple multiplication to a matrix multiplication (dot product). Secondly, we will add a so called *activation function* to map this value between 0 or 1. Let's remind ourselves again of our simple model:\n",
