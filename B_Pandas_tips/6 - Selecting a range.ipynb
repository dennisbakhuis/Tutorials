    "# Pandas tip #6: Selecting a range\n",
    "Selecting and filtering data from a DataFrame is the core business of a data scientist. There are many methods in Pandas to help you select or eliminate the rows. The all-rounder is clearly the .loc[] method and it share some similarities with boolean masking from Numpy. The first time a saw the method using square brackets instead of curly braces, I thought it was a bit weird. Between the brackets, the first number is the row pattern and second is the column pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can combine multiple rules by using the & operator. A few years ago, I thought that this was required when selecting ranges, however, Pandas has the very nifty .between() method. This is not only shorter but also makes it more readable. "
