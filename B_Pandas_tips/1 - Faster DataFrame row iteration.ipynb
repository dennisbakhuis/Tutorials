    "# Pandas tip #1: Faster DataFrame row Iteration\n",
    "Vectorizing the data is often the fastest way to process the data. There are however situations that you are still need to iterate through each row of a DataFrame. Reasons are most often that you solve a problem (too) \"quick and dirty\". This is fine for one-time processing and if it is in the order of minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "When iterating over each row, many use the .iterrows() function of the DataFrame. This method returns the index and a Series object. Pandas cannot guarantee that it returns a view or a copy, therefore, do not change the data you are iterating over directly. Changes you make might not be preserved. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas offers another method to iterate over each row: .itertuples(). The .itertuples() method returns a namedtuple object and depending on an option also returns the index. This method returns the same information as .iterrows() while not giving the illusion that you can change the original DataFrame using the iteration. But the best part is that it is 14 times faster than .iterrows(). Lets demonstrate this:"
