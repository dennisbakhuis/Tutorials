    "As many others, I love Python as you very rapidly translate your ideas in very readable code solutions. One reason why it is so successful is the very active community in which amazing people share their awesome solutions. This is why you do not have to write Data structures from scratch, but you simply import Pandas. Write the data to an hdf5 file format? Import h5py! Plot some figure, xkcd style? Import matplotlib! Even better, there are multiple *flavors* so if you prefer to Plot your data in a different way, import one of the various other plotting system, e.g. Plotly, Bokeh, ggplot, to name a few. All this sharing goodness makes that Python is quite popular in many rapid evolving fields, such as Machine Learning."

    "Unfortunately, all effort from the large community comes at a price. The packages you used get updated, restructured, improved, or just rewritten, because the authors came up with a better way to solve their problem. These changes can be *breaking* changes for the code you have written. Popular packages, such as Numpy or Matplotlib are very reliable, and chances that you get breaking changes are slim. However, using packages that are not as popular, breaking changing can happen, especially when upgrading the package or the version of Python itself."

    "A way, the Python community solved this problem is with the use of virtual environments. These create isolated Python installations with their own set of packages. It is good practice to have a unique environment for each project or task. This ensures that dependencies of one project will not create breaking changes for another. This solution works great, but also creates some bookkeeping as you have different Python installations, for which each might come with their own package manager Pip. All of these references pointing Python and/or Pip can create a mess quite quickly and we end up in the famous diagram van XKCD below (https://xkcd.com/1987/):\n",

    "While all XKCDs are funny they generally contain some truth and indeed, if you do not have some sort of system to do the bookkeeping, your Python installations can become a mess. As with all things in Python, there are many different ways to organize this, including some great tools such as Poetry, Pipenv, and many more. In the next section I will describe the system I am using. This works for me and this might also work for you. These are just my two cents, and you should do whatever suits you.\n"

    "### 2a) Drop the gui and use a shell\n",
    "There are probably very nice and flexible graphical user interfaces (GUIs) out there, however I prefer the command line interace (CLI) over them. They give me the impression that I am more in control. I am not sure if that is true, but at least I get confirmation over each step that I am doing. There are many different shells to choose from and it really does not matter that much. Use the one you have available is generally the easiest. When you spend more time in the CLI, you might get pickier one day and choose a different *flavor*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Windows** has two different CLIs installed by default, the Command Line Prompt (CMD) and Windows Powershell. Both are fine, but the power shell gives more of an shell feeling. If you have never used a CLI, it can be useful to watch a tutorial of the power shell on youtube. While I have not used Windows for a while, there are other options including running the famous linux bash shell on windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**MacOs** has by default bash (MacOs Catalina has Zsh) which is great. You can access the shell using the Terminal application which is a way to interact with bash or zsh.

If you are not familiar with bash, I highly advice to watch a tutorial on it, as it is incredibly useful.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 2B) Installing the conda package manager\n",
    "Now that we are familiar with a shell, lets get the next requirement: a conda distribution. Conda is a popular package manager for Python (and many other languages) and gives you access practically all Python versions and packages. It includes a easy system to manage virtual environments. While conda can be used to install packages, I only use it for virtual environments and Python versions. Conda has a feature called dependency checking, which works quite well, but sometimes can be a bit slow. Also, some packages are newer using Pip and therefore I chose to only use pip. Mixing both will probably work but it is probably better to just use a single tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, conda is installed using Anaconda, which is a full fledged distribution, including many packages, tools and a GUI. It installs many packages you will probably never use and I find the GUI slow to work with. The other option to install conda is to use miniconda, another distribution which is much smaller as the name suggests. Miniconda is a base installation with a Python system, Pip, Conda, and some other tools. While it is straight forward to install, here are some simple guide lines:\n",
    "- Install in your *home directory* **if and only if** you do *not* have spaces in the full path. For example, if you have a username using a space, e.g. \"dennis bakhuis\", your home directory path will also contain a space (/home/dennis bakhuis/). This can cause problems with some packages as not all imports use quotes around paths, which is required for spaces folder names. If you happen to have a space in the folder, install miniconda in a different location. For example in Windows, just use the root directory: C:\\miniconda3\n",
    "- After installing miniconda, you should have the conda command available in your shell. To test this, open your shell and type \"conda --version\". If the command is not found, the path to miniconda has to be added to the global path. \n",
    "- For powershell users, there is an additional step which can be typt in the powershell: \"conda init powershell\"\n",
